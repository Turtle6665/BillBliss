# BillBliss - Simplifying Shared Budget Management

BillBliss is a web application designed to streamline shared budget management on any mobile device. It helps you keep track of who purchased what, when, and for whom, making it easier to settle expenses among a group of people. This mobile-optimized web app uses the [ihatemoney.org (IHM)](https://ihatemoney.org) server for its backend, providing a convenient and user-friendly interface for users on their phones.

## Features

- Create and manage shared budget projects effortlessly.
- Record purchases, specifying the buyer, item, date, price, and recipients.
- Keep track of expenses and balances within the group.
- Settle bills easily by tracking who owes whom.

## Getting Started

To use BillBliss, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new shared budget project on the [ihatemoney.org (IHM)](https://ihatemoney.org/create) interface.
Skip this step if you already have a project.
2. Access your project and create an invitation link on IHM, which should look like this:
   - Example IHM link: [https://ihatemoney.org/demo/join/WyJkZW1vIl0.rbig1PJ6ix7k84G2uGeYExONoWE](https://ihatemoney.org/demo/join/WyJkZW1vIl0.rbig1PJ6ix7k84G2uGeYExONoWE)
3. Convert the IHM link to a BillBliss link by appending it as a parameter to the dashboard URL:
   - Example BillBliss link: [https://turtle6665.github.io/BillBliss/dashboard.html?project=demo&token=WyJkZW1vIl0.rbig1PJ6ix7k84G2uGeYExONoWE](https://turtle6665.github.io/BillBliss/dashboard.html?project=demo&token=WyJkZW1vIl0.rbig1PJ6ix7k84G2uGeYExONoWE)
